# Data Link Layer Error Correction Project

   This project focuses on implementing various [*Error Correction*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code) Techniques at the data link layer.
   Below, you'll find detailed explanations of each implemented method.


## Implemented methods


   * [Reed Solomon Codes](Reed%20Solomon%20Codes)

   Reed Solomon Codes are non-binary cyclic error-correcting codes that are widely used in digital communication systems,particularly in applications where burst errors are common. These codes are based on polynomial division in the Galois field and can correct errors in both the data and parity symbols. Reed Solomon codes are used in various storage media such as CDs, DVDs, and QR codes.

   * [Binary Convolutional Codes](Binary%20Convolutional%20Codes)

   Binary Convolutional Codes are a type of error-correcting code used in digital communication systems for forward error correction.
   These codes are generated by passing the input data through a shift register and XOR gates, producing a coded sequence that is transmitted along with the original data. At the receiver end, the same convolutional code is used to decode the received sequence and correct errors.

   * [Low Density Parity Check Codes (LDPC)](Low%20Density%20Parity%20Check%20Codes)

   Low Density Parity Check Codes are a class of error-correcting codes that operate on sparse bipartite graphs.
   These codes offer excellent error correction performance and are used in various communication systems, including wireless communication and digital video broadcasting. LDPC codes are decoded using iterative algorithms such as the belief propagation algorithm, which iteratively updates the probabilities of the bits being correct based on the received information.

   - Each of these error correction techniques plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable communication over noisy channels,
   and their implementation in this project provides a comprehensive understanding of their operation and performance characteristics.
